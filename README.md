## My process

- Used CSS custom properties to style the page.
- Used Flexbox and CSS Grid to position the elements in the page.
- Used Media Queries to make the page responsive to different screen size.
- Added hover states to the interactive elements on the page.
- Added a bit of Javascript to provide the toggle functionality in mobile view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned how to use override propery to hide the overlapping pattern in the background.
- Positioning a pattern on the left hand side and right hand side using CSS properties only.
- How to use media queries to make the page responsive to different screen size.
- How to position the image to give it a hanging look.

### Challenges I faced

- Positioning the pattern on the left hand side and right hand side using CSS properties only.
- And adjusting this pattern on the smaller screen size because the pattern gets overlapped in bigger screen. Hence I could not position the pattern properly in smaller screen.

### Accessibility feedback i got

--Comment-1: The page content should be contained by landmarks

`<section class="section" id="different">`

-üß© Common mistakes to avoid

‚ùå No <main> tag at all.

‚ùå More than one <main> tag. (You can have multiple <section>s, but only one <main>.)

‚ùå Nesting <main> inside another landmark (like inside <header> or <footer>).

To fix:

Add exactly one <main> in your HTML.

Wrap all main page content inside it.

Make sure it‚Äôs not inside <header>, <nav>, or <footer>.

--Comment-2: Heading levels should only increase by one

`<h4 class="service-title">Snappy Process</h4>.`

Headings in HTML represent the outline or hierarchy of your page content.
They help:

Screen readers understand document structure.

Search engines understand topic organization.

Users visually follow the flow of information.

The rule says:
‚û°Ô∏è You should not skip heading levels.

So you shouldn‚Äôt go from an <h1> directly to an <h4> ‚Äî you should go <h1> ‚Üí <h2> ‚Üí <h3> ‚Üí <h4> in order.
So changed the heading in services section from <h3> to <h4>.

### Continued development

- I want to work on improving the responsive design and adding more animations to the page.
