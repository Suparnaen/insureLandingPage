### What I learned

- Learned how to use override propery to hide the overlapping pattern in the background.
- Positioning a pattern on the left hand side and right hand side using CSS properties only.
- How to use media queries to make the page responsive to different screen size.
- How to position the image to give it a hanging look.

### Challenges I faced

- Positioning the pattern on the left hand side and right hand side using CSS properties only.
- And adjusting this pattern on the smaller screen size because the pattern gets overlapped in bigger screen. Hence I could not position the pattern properly in smaller screen.

### Continued development

- I want to work on improving the responsive design and adding more animations to the page.
